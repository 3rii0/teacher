    "Building a GitHub pages home page, then connecting the home page to  other pages is a common first step in building a project.  To start you will need to form your `index.md` in your project, which behind the scenes is generated into an `index.html` by the GitHub Pages build process.  Every page should have a `title`.  The `_layouts` directory in the classrooms starting project contains a `default.html`, this is the goto layout for each of our pages.  Here is frontmatter sample...\n",

Review the `index.md` of the [teacher repository](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/teacher/blob/main/index.md).  On this page, you will observe some information on the courses at Del Norte High School.  Also, on the link  you will see symbols like \"include nav_home.html\" and references that look like \"broken links\".  \n",

    "- GitHub Pages, [Fully rendered link](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher/).  This is the link we share with friends or community.\n",
    "- GitHub, [Partial rendered link](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/teacher/blob/main/index.md).  This is the link developer typically discovers in a project, GitHub tried to present markdown in a pretty form by default.\n",
    "- GitHub raw, [Source link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nighthawkcoders/teacher/main/index.md).  The raw link is in the project, but requires a 2nd click after discovery in GitHub.  This contains the source the developer creates when building the pages.\n",

    "## Hacks\n",
    "Go forward with information provided in all the lessons up to now and try to complete a home page for a project and make a new .md file in _posts for one of the hacks describe below.  Connect the hack with the home page, index.md.  These items listed are considered prevalent on the internet.  In this Teachers opinion, this is more of finding and moving code into your project, not so much a development project.    This process is to finding code, learning the pieces, and then moving into your project is called integration.  If you are doing a lot of coding, you may be over working the coding part, focus more on the integration part!\n",

    "Overall, this project offers a good foundation for high school students to dive into web development using GitHub Pages. It provides guidance on creating a home page, integrating content and features, and suggests fun and engaging projects for students to explore. With the provided links and hacks, students should have plenty of resources and ideas to start building their own GitHub Pages projects."
