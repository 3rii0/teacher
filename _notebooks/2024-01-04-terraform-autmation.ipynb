    "`Cloud Computing`.  Traditionally, classroom have been service by on premise  desktops; costs can be high and aging is rapid. The purpose of this project is to build workspaces in the cloud; students would use their District issued Chromebook to access these workspaces.   Numbers say this could be much more affordable.  However, a key concern in this process is to build, scale, and manager these workpaces.\n",

    "Automating Cloud Setups.  The following illustration shows a `Terraform` recipe being pushed to the `AWS EC2` computer and generating an `Ubuntu Linux` workspace.   The names `kasm1, kasm2, ...` represent machines using `KASM workspaces`, a containerized desktop software provider.  \n",

There are many additional Terraform, AWS and/or KASM features to allocate resources, scal resources, and timeout inactive workspace sessions.  Additionally, `machines can be put to sleep`, for instance 11pm to 7am daily to save on cost.  Or, `woken up` based off of demand weekends and holidays.\n"
