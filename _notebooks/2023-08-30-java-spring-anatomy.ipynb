    "\n",
    "- `README.md`: This file contains instructions and information about the project. It is a standard component of all properly set up GitHub projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pom.xml`: This file is the Maven Project Object Model (POM) file. It defines the project configuration, dependencies, build settings, and other metadata required for building and managing the Java project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `src/main/java/`: This directory contains your Java source code files, including controllers, services, models, and other backend components of your Spring application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `src/main/resources/static/`: This directory is the location for static web resources such as CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets that will be served directly by the web server without any processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `src/main/resources/templates/`: This directory contains Thymeleaf template files. These are dynamic HTML templates that can be rendered on the server-side and populated with data from your Java code. Thymeleaf provides powerful templating features and allows you to create dynamic web pages with Java integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `application.properties` or `application.yml`: These files contain configuration properties for the Spring application. They can include settings related to the database connection, server port, logging, security, and other application-specific configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Main.java`: This Java file contains the main entry point of the Spring application. It is annotated with @SpringBootApplication and includes the main method to start the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SecurityConfiguration.java`: This Java file is a Java class that typically plays a crucial role in configuring the security aspects of a web application using Spring Security framework. It is responsible for defining security rules, authentication mechanisms, authorization policies, and other security-related configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `...ApiController.java`: These Java files define the web controllers responsible for handling incoming requests and generating appropriate responses. They typically use annotations like @RestController or @Controller to define the request mapping endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `...ServiceImpl.java`: These Java files contain the business logic of the application. They encapsulate complex operations and provide services to the controllers. Service classes are often annotated with @Service.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `...JpaRepository.java`: These Java files define the data access layer of the application. They interact with the database or other data sources to perform CRUD operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this is a general overview, and the specific file and directory structure can vary as any project progresses or the framework change."
