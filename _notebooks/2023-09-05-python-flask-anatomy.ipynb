    "- ```README.md``` file contains instruction to setup tools and clone the project.  A README is a standard for all properly setup GitHub project.\n",
    "- ```requirements.txt``` file contains the dependencies required to make this Python project into a Flask/Python project.  Additionally, other backend requirements are contained within ths file, for example dependencies for making a database.\n",
    "- ```main.py``` is a Python source file to run the project.  This file starts a Flask web server locally, on localhost.  This is the file you start during development to run, test, and debug the project.\n",
    "- ```Dockerfile``` and ```docker-compose.yml``` are the official files to run and test the project.  These files run the project in the same manner as when it is deployed on a server.  By running this file you check to see if your tools and dependencies will work on another machine, ie AWS EC2 server.\n",
    "- ```instances``` this is the standard location for putting data files that you want to remain on server.  For instance, SQLite database files are stored in this directory.\n",
    "- ```static``` directory is the standard location for files that you want to have cached by the web server.  For instance image files (jpeg, png, ...) or js files that remain constant during execution of the web server.\n",
    "- ```api``` is the directory that contains code to receive and respond to a request from an external server.  This is the interface from the external world into logic and code in the remainder of this project.\n",
    "- ```model``` these are the files that contain backend implementation for many of the files in the api directory.  For instance, there are files in model which directly interact with the database.\n",
    "- ```templates``` these are files and directories that are used to support home and error pages for this web site.   \n",
    "- ```.gitignore``` this file excludes elements from version controls.  We exclde files when they are built, they are NOT original source but derived.  You will see some files as dim in the VSCode Explorer, these files are purposely excluded from version control by rules in .gitignore.\n",
