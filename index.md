## Investing in your Technical Future
> Explore the Pathway in Computer Science at Del Norte High School.  In the pathway you will be working on Projects, and Collaborating with Peers.  All the Del Norte CompSci classes are designed toward a "Real World" experience.  Class time includes tech talks (lectures), collaboration with peers, communication with teacher(s), critical thinking while coding, and creativity in projects.  Total work time is 5 to 7 hours of work per week, 5 hours in class and 2 hours of technical work outside of class.  Grading is focused on time invested, participation with peers, and engagement in learning.

## Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE) 1,2; Grades 9-12 
> CSSE prepares students for the AP Computer Science pathway. This course will teach the JavaScript programming language and develop computational thinking skills. This course generate excitement about the field of computing by learning through Game Development and fostering collaboration with Peers.  Tech Talks will be given by Teachers to introduce concepts, tools and ideas that establish requirements for development.  Through development and exploration this course aims to build students’ awareness of the tremendous workplace demand for computer and software engineering in all fields.
- Prerequisites: none 
- Meets UC/CSU G requirements

## Computer Science Principles 1,2 and Data Structures 1; Grades 10-12
> Computer Science Principles is designed as a college-level introduction to a computer science.   The AP Computer Science Principles curriculum is integrated into this course: creative development, data, algorithms and programming, computer systems and networks, and impact of computing. There will be individual and team projects build computer systems, write algoritms, analyze for correctness, and engage in discussions about the solutions.  Projects will establish fluency in Python, use prerequisites knowledge in JavaScript, and establish fluency in Linux.
- Prerequisites: 10th grade requires Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE),  11th -12th grades requires GPA above 3.5, there is expectation of experience with JavaScript or other programming languages.
- Meets UC/CSU G requirements, also alternate for D requirement

> Data Structures 1 is serving as third trimester for this class. This computer science course is the capstone for non-computer science majors/minors and prepares others to complete PUSD computer science pathway. The focus of Data Structures, in conjunction with completing APCSP, is to create computer programs on your own. This course includes AP review and AP project time.  The JavaScript and Python languages are used in this course to instruct the Imperative and Object Oriented programming paradigm. Topics covered: graphical user interfaces, input and output, lists, dictionaries, databases, searching, sorting, and algorithm analysis. 
- Prerequisites: AP Computer Science Principles 1-2 
- Meets UC/CSU G requirements

## Computer Science "A" 1,2 and Data Structures 2; Grades 11-12
> AP Computer Science A is an in-depth practice and application of programming, algorithms, and data structures. The AP Computer Science ‘A’  curriculum is integrated into this course which includes the Java Programming language and the these topics:  fundamentals of programming, using objects, writing classes, arrays, array lists, 2D arrays, inheritance, and recursion.  Students cultivate an understanding of these topics by analyzing, writing code, and creating projects individually and and in teams.  Projects will establish fluency in Java, use JavaScript, and use Linux.
- Prerequisites: AP Computer Science Principles or Teacher recommendation with an expectation of understanding of both JavaScript, Linux, and working in team Projects.
- Meets UC/CSU C or G requirements, also alternate for C requirement

> Data Structures 2 is serving as third trimester for this class. This computer science course is the capstone for Del Norte Computer Science Pathway. This is a companion to APCS ‘A'. This course focuses on Basic Data Structures, Algorithms and includes AP preparation for College Board MCQs and FRQs.  The JavaScript and Java languages are used in this course to instruct on Object Oriented programming paradigm programming and design. Topics covered: searching, sorting, hashing, algorithm analysis,  collections, lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, dictionaries, and graphs.  The course concludes with Team oriented Project-based learning and a final project.
- Prerequisites: AP Computer Science ‘A’ 1,2
- Meets UC/CSU G requirements
- Data Structures 1,2 receives Articulated College Credit to Mira Costa CC, requires free registration
