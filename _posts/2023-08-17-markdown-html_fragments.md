## HTML Fragments and Markdown
Building an entire Web Application frontend requires HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  In GitHub Pages a lot of the frontend design work has been done by selecting and using a theme.   Jekyll takes our choice of theme in our _config.yml file, along with our HTML and Markdown fragments to build a complete static website.

In the greater coding of GitHub Pages, Jekyll and Liquid build and programmatically construct each page specific to the fragments in a specific page.  In GitHub Pages, you can build HTML from a language called Markdown (.md files).  Building in markdown allows you to take advantage of Jekyll conversions to HTML. 


### Review these Fragments
#### Table Fragments
In GitHub Pages you can build a table in HTML or Markdown.  
- The index.md use markdown conversion and builds a page about CompSci courses at Del Norte High School


#### Images
In GitHub Pages you can insert images in HTML or Markdown.  The Teacher finds \<img\> easier to work with for embedding links when trying to control size.
- See index.md for "img" usage
- Lookup !\[\]\(\) syntax for images in markdown guides


#### Links
Look up \<href\> and \[\]\(\) syntax in both HTML and Markdown.  These should become easy and familiar.


### Web Page Layout
A complete HTML Web Application is typically made off of a Layout and a series of Fragments (sometimes called templates).  
- The design of GitHub pages allows us to change themes with the _config.yml file key/value, change the value to a [supported theme](https://pages.github.com/themes/).
- Students <mark>spending majority or large portions of time writing custom CSS which can be counter productive</mark>.  It is better to learn to extend or change a GitHub theme.


## Hacks
At the end of this week you should select your theme and start customizing your page. 
- Try altering weekly plan on what you intend to do.
- Try altering index.md with image and links according to your plan.
