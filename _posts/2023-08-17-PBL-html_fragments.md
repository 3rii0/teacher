## HTML Fragments and Markdown
Building an entire Web Application frontend requires HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  In GitHub Pages a lot of the frontend design work has been done by using a theme.   Jekyll takes our choice of theme in our _config.yml file, along with our HTML and Markdown fragments to build a complete static website.

Fragments in HTML are a way to abstract complexity.  The greater coding system we use is GitHub Pages which uses Jekyll and Liquid to build and programmatically construct the page specific fragments into the theme of the larger web site.

### Review these Fragments
#### Table Fragments
In Fastpages you can build a table in HTML or Markdown.  Building in markdown allows you to take advantage of Jekyll.  
- The index.md does markdown conversion and builds a table with blogs

#### Images
In Fastpages you can insert images in HTML or Markdown.  The Teacher finds \<img\> easier to work with for embedding links when trying to control size.
- See index.md for "img" usage
- Lookup !\[\]\(\) syntax for images in markdown guides

#### Links
Look up \<href\> and \[\]\(\) syntax in both HTML and Markdown.  These should become easy and familiar.


### Web Page Layout
A complete HTML Web Application is typically made off of a Layout and a series of Fragments (sometimes called templates).  
- The design of GitHub pages allows us to change themes with the _config.yml file key/value, change the value to a [supported theme](https://pages.github.com/themes/).
- Students <mark>spending majority or large portions of time writing custom CSS which can be counter productive</mark>.  It is better to learn to extend or change a GitHub theme.


## Hacks
At the end of this week you should select your theme and start customizing your page. 
- Try altering weekly plan on what you intend to do.
- Try altering index.md with image and links according to your plan.
