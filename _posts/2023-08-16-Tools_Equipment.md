## Make Development Easy
Learning Development tools, working with Projects, is the key to a <mark>rapid entry into Code/Code/Coding</mark>.  A Computer, Git, and an Code Editor are the starting points for coding.  Add Jupyter Notebooks (computational documents) and you bridge a Computer with Data Science.  The beauty of Jupyter Notebooks is that it creates a computational narrative, a document that allows code and data with visual analysis, hypothesis, and conjecture.

- A laptop, <mark>bring a laptop to class every day with the Development Tools installed</mark> on it.  Preferred laptops are MacOS or Windows.  Computers using either MacOS, Windows, or Linux are requirements for the course.  Computers issued by the School, ie Chromebook, are not as effective because of the restrictions placed on adding software by PUSD.  <mark>If you only have access to a school issued Chromeboo, we will provide an option to access a Linux machine on AWS.</mark>
- Sharing Code. <mark>GitHub</mark>, is the defacto hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere in the world.  Think of it as the Google Docs for Coders. We will clone/push/pull changes to and from GitHub, this is the server where we store and share code in the cloud, think of Google Docs but for Code.  
   - Setup GitHub with a personal ID, not a school ID.  [GitHub Account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account).  
- <mark>Visual Studio Code</mark> (abbreviations VS Code, VSCode or VSC) is a powerful Code Editor.  VSCode performs a lot of magic and automation behind the scenes to make your Code/Code/Coding life easier, ie telling you about errors in syntax.
   - [VSCode Setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics.)
- GitHub Pages will be used to host your personal web site, notes, and experiences. <mark>Review GitHub concepts 2-min</mark> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phGdqJB6ep0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phGdqJB6ep0)
- Jupyter Notebooks will be used to build running JavaScript, Python, orJava Code in to your own Technical Notes. <mark>Review Jupyter basics 6-min</mark> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZYC9rGrNg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZYC9rGrNg)
- Slack Account, install App on Laptop, get used to reading announcements. Slack is a messaging tool similar to Discord, there will be daily messages in this class.
    - [Slack for Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows)
    - [Slack for MacOS](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/downloads/mac)
    - [Slack for Linux](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/downloads/linux)
- [Windows Desktops install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).   This install Linux on Windows.  Everyone in this class with be working on Linux when in Terminal. WSL users will install WSL 2 and Ubuntu distriibutions.
- Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker Desktop, users can test deployment scripts on their local machine, enabling debugging prior to deploping on AWS. 
    - [Docker Desktop for Macos](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)  
    - [Docker Desktop for WSL2 Backend on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/#:~:text=With%20Docker%20Desktop%20running%20on,to%20improve%20the%20resource%20consumption.)
- Tools and Terminal Installs
   - Anaconda is the environment manager.  Conda is an open-source package and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops.  It helps you manage you tools in a controlled environment, called a virtual environment.
   - Homebrew (```brew install```) for MacOS will be used to install tools,  Apple's MacOS does not have these by default.
   - On Windows we will install Windows Subystem for Linux (WSL Ubuntu), then use ```sudo apt install` installs the packages (Java, Python) you need for Development that Ubuntu did not include.
   - On AWS Linux EC2 machines we will use ```sudo apt install``` for tools installation. An AWS Account for cloud computing will be required.  , account access will be provided by Teacher.  AWS Cloud Computing and Electric Cloud Computing (EC2's) will be used to run Development Enviornment from the Internet.

## Hacks
> Rreview all the items mentioned above and get started with setup.  It is very important to understand concepts of these tools and ask questions for clarity
- If you don't have computer and tools access, you are effectually absent!!!  
- Installing tools can be a bit of a process.  Read, review, and get started.  After you do it a little, it starts to become easy.
- Do not fear your tools, <mark>love your tools'</mark>.  You will understand this more as you become a Developer.  Why do you think you might love your tools?
