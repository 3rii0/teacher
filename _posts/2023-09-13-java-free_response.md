### FRQ Hacks
> During the year we need to learn the four types of FRQs.  This i

- FRQ No. 1: Methods and Control Structures
    - Pick a question of type 01 from one of the years posted on the former EXAM page.  Solve the problem, including missing pieces in a Jupyter Notebook.  
    - Make this a quality blog.  My suggestion each member of team do a different FRQs, to make reviews and grading more valuable.
    - Browse through multiple questions, find a question that may be have future PBL interest.

> Repeat for other FRQ Types
- FRQ No. 2: Classes
- FRQ No. 3: Array/ArrayList
- FRQ No. 4: 2D Array 

### Regarding Array/ArrayList/2D Arrays
> It is really import that each student learn to iterate through Arrays, ArrayLists, and 2D arrays.  On these FRQs, make sure you do some extra work to highlight these concepts, if they are not present in the FRQ.
- Change or add data to arrays, easier for ArrayList.  How would you do it for others?
- Displaying Array/ArrayList by columns, as well as by rows
horizontally
- Display content backwards

## Live Grading Presentation.Â  
> On Live grading day each team will present to another Tables/Teams while presenting to the Teacher.  Each team will have 10 minutes to go over their FRQs.
- Create a Team Review and Review Ticket for all 4 FRQs. 
    
> Presentation.  Introduce lesson and introduce how you plan to present the Material(s).  
- Have parts that each person will go over.
- Consider an activity or illustration other than Code/Code/Coding to learn about each FRQ.
- Outside sources can be used to complement the lesson: College Board, Khan Academy, etc
- It would be interesting if you adapt FRQs, so that they work together.  This would show your ability to plan and produce something useful.

> Live Review requirements
- If code is not give by College Board you must complete it, you FRQs must run.
- Jupyter Notebooks contain comments and markdown cells that describe work, in this case it should be easy to understand FRQ, purpose, and funciton.
- Show grades and blog(s)/comments  used during reviews.
- Java output of cells in Jupyter Notebook is required when posting.
