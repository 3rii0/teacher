title:  Free Response Mini-lab project
description: The focus of this mini-lab is preparing for the FRQ question types tested by College Board.  A great deal of energy should be spent on researching and preparing a lesson on each topic.

## Mini-Labs
The goal of FRQ mini-labs is to help you explore, learn to code, and establish the abililty to communicate and collaborate with you team members.

### Continuous Communication is Key
If there is one important skill you quickly need to pick up on at the start of your Project Journey, it is to: code, communicate, commit, communicaaaate!!!

I’ll repeat it as much as it needs for it to sink into your brain. Communicate your work as often as need be! The pace can be fast in tech, so if you want to make sure all your work does not go for naught, then communication is required.

How can you do that?
1. Update your team members regularly on your progress, even if you’re not finished yet. 

    One effective way you can do this is by sharing small nuggets (the most interesting pieces or insights on work) with the relevant people (pair programmer, team, cross over team, and teacher).  

    Just make sure to organize or prepare beforehand. You can do that via:

    - Messages: Slack, Discord, Emails…
    - Preparation for share-outs messages, standup team meets, live reviews
    - 1:1 meetings 

    Whenever you stumble on a noteworthy insight, prepare and send. It is expected that these preparation and shares will help you find holes, inconcistencies, sort out misunderstandings on key concepts, etc.


2. Make sure to find the right sharing cadence for you, team members, and stake holders.

    Iterate over different sharing frequencies until you find the right one for you and your stakeholders.  Sharing at the end or when finished is THE WRONG ANSWER.  Remember, everything in tech is a “Work in Progress”.  
    
    In school, we can go way to long working hard in a bubble only sharing when we think we are done. Sharing includes committing code frequently.  In tech, no one has time for late sharing and late commits. So pick up the sharing pace, share frequently and commit frequently!

### FRQ Hacks
> During the year we need to learn the four types of FRQs.

- FRQ No. 1: Methods and Control Structures
    - Pick a question of type 01 from one of the years posted on the former EXAM page.  Solve the problem, including missing pieces in a Jupyter Notebook.  
    - Make this a quality blog.  My suggestion each member of team do a different FRQs, to make reviews and grading more valuable.
    - Browse through multiple questions, find a question that may be have future PBL interest.

> Repeat for other FRQ Types
- FRQ No. 2: Classes
- FRQ No. 3: Array/ArrayList
- FRQ No. 4: 2D Array 

### Regarding Array/ArrayList/2D Arrays
> It is really import that each student learn to iterate through Arrays, ArrayLists, and 2D arrays.  On these FRQs, make sure you do some extra work to highlight these concepts, if they are not present in the FRQ.
- Change or add data to arrays, easier for ArrayList.  How would you do it for others?
- Displaying Array/ArrayList by columns, as well as by rows
horizontally
- Display content backwards

## Live Grading Presentation.  
> On Live grading reviews each team will present to another Tables/Teams while presenting to the Teacher.  Each team will have 10 minutes to go over their FRQs.
- Create a Team Review and Review Ticket for all 4 FRQs with each Team Member participating in the discussion.
    
> Presentation.  Introduce 'FRQ lesson' and introduce how you plan to present the Material(s).  
- Have parts that each person will go over.
- Consider an activity or illustration other than Code/Code/Coding to learn about each FRQ.
- Outside sources can be used to complement the lesson: College Board, Khan Academy, etc
- It would be interesting if you adapt FRQs, so that they work together.  This would show your ability to plan and produce something useful.

> Live Review requirements
- If code is not give by College Board you must complete it, you FRQs must run.
- Jupyter Notebooks contain comments and markdown cells that describe work, in this case it should be easy to understand FRQ, purpose, and funciton.
- Show grades and blog(s)/comments  used during reviews.
- Java output of cells in Jupyter Notebook is required when posting.
