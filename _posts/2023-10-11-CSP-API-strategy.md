## API, Data Resources

Applications, Web Applications are nothing without data.  After many reviews, Teachers are concerned that many groups are not making the effort to understand and look at Data. 

### API Terms and Postman

Knowing Terms and Postman needs to be a part of your vocabular and dmonstrations as you move into Feature, Integration, and Final reviews.  

- [API Control, Model, Postman](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP/2023/01/19/PBL-control.html)  Make your live review more interesting by completing and showing hacks discussed in this guide for your solution.

### Variation off of Jokes

Student teams have opportunity for 90% if they do a variation of Jokes.  However, this is considered about 10 hours of work for both frontend and backend.   So, there would need to be a couple of variation to meet team goals.

- [Frontend Fetch of Jokes](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP/techtalk/webfrontend).  In this code example you will learn many of the key Frontend requirements in displaying the Jokes API.  This meets 1/2 the requirements for this project.

- [Python Web API for Jokes](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP/techtalk/webapi).  Review this document that describes how to make Model and Interface endpoints.

### Alternative to Jokes variation

Student teams need could look into fetching content and learning [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) on AWS server to hide keys.  This is fundamental for using ChatGPT.  Additionally, you would add your own API over the top of the 3rd Party API.  This would be required for anyone doing Food, Cars, Fitness or other types of content that have tons of APIs.

- [Python 3rd Party API](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP/techtalk/rapidapi).  It can be beneficial to access APIs in the backend versus the frontend.  Plus, this two step process will meet Frontend to Backend API requirements.
  - ChatGPT APIs need keys hidden on server.
  - Rate limits can be controlled on backend.

### 100% and CPT project

Starting to learn about persistent data and databases with APIs is something that will put you ahead of the game.  Above expectations would require some original work or thinking.  

- [User Database API](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP/2023/04/11/AP-writeup-sample.html).  This is a more advanced approach to APIs, but learning this will prepare you for requirements and language of Create Performance Task, the CSP project.
