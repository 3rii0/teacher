# CSA course meta data
Unit1:
  title: Tools and Software Development Processes
  description: Students should have experience in blogging, coding with Jupyter Notebooks, and GitHub Pages; understnding of Linux, Python, Markdown, HTML, and JavaScript is expected. Students have previously  established foundation using essential tools and software development processes.  Weeks 0-3 will provide a quick review and students will start their Java coding journey.

  start: 0
  end: 3
Unit2:
  title: Java Mini-labs
  description: Students have been introduced to Classes and Inheritance in Python and JavaScript.  In this unit students will become more familiar with Java development and classes through Mini-labs.  These labs will introduce AP required aspects of Java, FRQ requirements, and start looking at College Boards 10 Units.

  start: 4
  end: 7
Unit3:
  title:  Individual/Team Projects, N@tM
  description: In this unit students will continue to become familiar with Java development and classes as they learn Web Development using the Spring Framework.  Coding will focus on receiving, working with data, and responding to requests.  This will teach key Java concepts while learning Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs), Object Relational Model (ORM) and Java Persistent API (JPA)

  start: 8
  end: 12
Unit4:
  title: College Board Teaching and Study 
  description: This period will perform formal teaching and grading on the 10 units by College Board.  Student teams will give tech talk to class and provide Hacks for the key areas in the Unit.  Students need to make sure the teach key College Board questions by review online materials and review plan with Teacher.  Student teams need to coordinate Hack turn in and grade homework.
  start: 13
  end: 16
Unit5:
  title: Passion Projects
  description: Objective of these weeks is to explore and create ideas and concepts for a Team two trimester project.  Adding frontend and creativity while using APIs/Databases.  This should be a project of personal and team interest.  Team projects that are most liked by Teachers and Students will be continued in Trimester 3.
  start: 17
  end: 20
Unit6:
  title: Creative Development and N@tM
  description: This will be most creative portion of year for CSA students.  Each person within "Student Teams" will have their own specialty within their student project that shows Full Stack competency, requiring Java as backend.  Intentions for this period is to have a free and creative period, driven by your Issues and Scrum Board.  Student should be able to talk about design, do fe/be coding, addd database features and perform weekly live reviews.  
  start: 21
  end: 24
Unit7: 
  title: Data Structures
  description: A focus Data Structures that relate to the AP exam.  A key requirement is to make your own Algo Rythmic sorting video.   The theme is produce work that can be used to help you pass the AP Exam and improve your Passion Project.  Each student must cover key concepts from one of the Four AP FRQ types, contain a key Data Structure, and utilize sorting. These requirements are fairly generic and could complement any project.
  start: 25
  end: 29
Unit8:
  title: AP Weeks
  description: Student will lead several study sessions (20 minute test, follow by review) the week before the exam.  In any break in study, students will transition activities to a final project.
  start: 30
  end: 32
Unit9:
  title: Final Project and N@tM
  description: Wrap up your preferred project.  There will be an opportunity to contribute and be published to the NightHawk Coding Society library.  If your project is selected, then you will receive a high 'A' on final.
